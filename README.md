# FlexPepDockNCAA
This serves as the official repository for the manuscript "Rosetta Flexpepdock to predict peptide-MHC binding: an approach for non-canonical amino acids"

The following data and code are included in this repository:
## Supplemental files for ab-initio crossdock
Includes all necessary starting data to re-capitulate the results reported in the manuscript crossdocking benchmarks including constraint files, fragment files, options files, and starting models. 

## TCR docking
Rosetta PDB files generated in the docking of G69Q and 5M02 to H-2Db with a TCR present for the top 5 scoring models, as well as input structures, fragment files, and constraints.

## HLA-A02:01 Crossdock
Rosetta PDB files generated in the crossdocking benchmark study of HLA-A*02:01 peptides for both ab-initio and refinement (top 10 structures by score for each peptide/receptor pair as reported in the manuscript)

## Phosphopeptides
Rosetta PDB files generated in the benchmark docking study of HLA-A*02:01 bound phosphopeptides for the top 5 scoring models for each posphopeptide/receptor pair.
